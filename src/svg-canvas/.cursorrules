We are developing an MCP server for the SVG Canvas API.
Check src/svg-canvas/README.md to get a basic idea of the project.
Check src/svg-canvas/TODO.md for the checklist of tasks to complete and update it as you work on the tasks.

Ensure that all runtime code will run on Windows, Mac and Linux by using cross-platform methods and tools where possible and handling different OS-specific behaviors where necessary.

Where possible follow a Test-Driven Development approach - first write a unit test that fails, then write the code to make the test pass.

index.ts is the entry point of the server and must be located in the root of the package. All other files should be in the src/ directory.
